  Fielding.  
  HOW now, doctor--what the plague  
 is the matter with Lucian, Cervantes,  
 Scarron, and the rest of them at the other  
 side of the fields there--they seem to be ac-  
 tuated by passions which I thought never  
troubled breasts in Elysium.  

Swift.  
THE matter with them --why Mercury  
has given them a bone to pick, that's all——  
have not you heard of the book he brought  
down with him last night, in the stage from  
the upper world-it has set them all a mad-  
ing--and Cervantes swears it shall be sent to   
the  

( 67 )   
the devils, that they may play at rackets  
with it, as they did with the second part  
of Don Quixote.  

Fielding.  
TRISTRAM Shandy I guess you mean——  
have been just hearing of it, from a &#017;oul  
which arrived about two hours——he tells  
me that the author is care&#017;&#017;ed by people of  
the first fashion——who strive one with each  
other, for the honour of filling his belly and  
his pockets——and, withal, that his works  
are preferr'd beyond any thing which either  
you or have written;  

Swift.  
You know I had always a contemptible  
opinion of those human brutes, and this very  
circumstance you mention is sufficient to ju&#017;  
tify my character of the yahoo——for nothing   
but a yahoo, both in taste and principles, could   
endure, much less admire such a Paltry per-  
formance.  

Fielding.   
AT lea&#017;t, it is a proof to what a low ebb  
the British genius is reduced; for it is a &#017;ign  
K 2. people  

( 68 )  

people are poor indeed, when they make a  
&#017;hew with farthings——but it seems you have   
read the book then.  

Swift.  
I just run it over, but there was such  
pulling among the curious to get it out of   
my hands——and Mercury &#017;ays it is the same  
thing above stairs too——where he should ne-  
ver have got an opportunity to steal it, if   
he had not watched his time, when one of  
the mo&#017;t &#017;ensible men in the kingdom, and  
one of the greates&#017;t authors——had fallen a  
&#017;leep over the fir&#017;t volume, &#017;o flipt that out  
of his hand, and the other from the table  
by him ; but I &#017;hall be &#017;urprized if we have  
them not in plenty before this day twelve-  
month, for I think Tri&#017;ram Shandy mu&#017;t   
be dead and buried by that time.  

Fielding.  
WELL, but prythee Swift, give us &#017;ome   
account of the work.  

Swift.  
 
( P69 )  
Swift.  
In a few words——it is a hotch potch of   
technical terms——broken sentencesb————trite  
&#017;atir-—obscenity——low buffoonery, without  
wit——humour——or de&#017;ign.  

Fielding.  
I beg pardon for interrupting you——but that   
word low is often given by the sons of dull-  
ness to humour the most exquisite——is there  
no humour in the book.  

Swift.  
WOULD you think there was humour——  
if  a blackguard in the &#017;treet &#017;hould pull  
down his breeches and shew you his dirty——  
If you would, then there is humour in Tris&#017;-  
tram Shandy.  

Fielding.  
How the devil can the town be &#017;o absurd  
then, as to put this man in competition with   
you and me.  

Swift.  

( 70)  

Swift.  
BECAUSE they are a pack of a&#017;&#017;es——but  
do not imagine that all do &#017o————a player  
that pretends to a ta&#017;te, perhaps, when he  
has none——or a rabble of fa&#017;hionable people  
may make a noi&#017e about him——as a mob  
often will do about nothing--but the few good  
judges, Mercury a&#017;&#017;ures me, hold his book  
in the contemptible light it de&#017;erves.  

Fielding.   
I fancy he owes the &#017ucce&#017;s of it to its  
not being understood.  

Swift.  
HE does moft certainly——the majority of  
the world are ignorant————and ignorance,  
whatever face it may put upon it outward-  
ly, is always conscious——the&#017;e, therefore,   
place to their own account—what &#017;hould be  
put to that of the author——true, they do   
not understand him——but they never con&#017;ider  
that he is not to be under&#017tood——in my opi-  
nion, any man who &#017;hould &#017;it down to  
write——if, at the &#017;ame time, he was not ab-  
solutely void of what is called the funny   
&#017;tile, might produce as good a Work——only  
going  

( 71 )  
going upon the &#017;imple principle, of putting  
down whatever came into his head.  

Fielding.  
But it piques my pride a little————that  
my Tom Jones &#017;hould be cry'd down for &#017;uch  
an upstart——my Tom Jones that co&#017;t me &#017;o  
many years labour.  

Swift.  
FIELDING, this is no place to fear flat-  
tery——the fable of your Tom Jones, &#017;etting  
aside its other merits, which are exce&#017;&#017;ive,  
is enough to put your fame beyond the   
reach of the contemptible extollers of Tri&#017;-   
tram Shandy.  

Fielding.  
MR. Dean, I know you &#017;peak what you  
think——and, becau&#017;e, this is a place where  
a man cannot be &#017;u&#017;pected of begging a far-  
ther compliment——I do a&#017;&#017;ure you, by what  
I can learn——your mo&#017;t trifling pamphlet——  
nay, one of your letters to doctor Sheridan,  
contains more laughable matter than all Tri&#017;-  
Tram Shandy.  

Swift  

( 72)   

Swift.  
I mu&#017;t not &#017;uffer my judgment to be bl-  
a&#017;&#017;ed, there is a &#017;ermon in Tri&#017;tram Shan-  
dy; which, to the re&#017;erve of &#017;ome parts of  
the &#017;tile, is excellent. But it is introduced,   
in a manner mo&#017;t improper and irreverent.  

Fielding.   
I do not think we are to be too &#017;evere   
in critici&#017;ing works of wit and humour, or   
in tying up an entertaining author in &#017;uch a manner,  
as not to &#017;uffer him to break out   
now and then into a little joco&#017;e merri-  
ment, though he &#017;hould &#017;ometimes go be-  
yond even a double entendre. , But an ab-  
&#017;olute violation of all mode&#017;ty————to take  
the language of a book from the mouths of  
the inhabitants of Exeter-&#017;treet, and Hedge  
lane. * * *  *Caetera desunt*.
