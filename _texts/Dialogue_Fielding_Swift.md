  Fielding.  
  HOW now, doctor--what the plague  
 is the matter with Lucian, Cervantes,  
 Scarron, and the rest of them at the other  
 side of the fields there--they seem to be ac-  
 tuated by passions which I thought never  
troubled breasts in Elysium.  

Swift.  
THE matter with them --why Mercury  
has given them a bone to pick, that's all——  
have not you heard of the book he brought  
down with him last night, in the stage from  
the upper world-it has set them all a mad-  
ing--and Cervantes swears it shall be sent to   
the  

( 67 )   
the devils, that they may play at rackets  
with it, as they did with the second part  
of Don Quixote.  

Fielding.  
TRISTRAM Shandy I guess you mean——  
have been just hearing of it, from a ſoul  
which arrived about two hours——he tells  
me that the author is careſſed by people of  
the first fashion——who strive one with each  
other, for the honour of filling his belly and  
his pockets——and, withal, that his works  
are preferr'd beyond any thing which either  
you or have written;  

Swift.  
You know I had always a contemptible  
opinion of those human brutes, and this very  
circumstance you mention is sufficient to juſ  
tify my character of the yahoo——for nothing   
but a yahoo, both in taste and principles, could   
endure, much less admire such a Paltry per-  
formance.  

Fielding.   
AT lea&ſt, it is a proof to what a low ebb  
the British genius is reduced; for it is aſign  
K 2. people  

( 68 )  

people are poor indeed, when they make a  
ſhew with farthings——but it seems you have   
read the book then.  

Swift.  
I just run it over, but there was such  
pulling among the curious to get it out of   
my hands——and Mercury ſays it is the same  
thing above stairs too——where he should ne-  
ver have got an opportunity to steal it, if   
he had not watched his time, when one of  
the moſt ſensible men in the kingdom, and  
one of the greatesſt authors——had fallen a  
ſleep over the firſt volume, ſo flipt that out  
of his hand, and the other from the table  
by him ; but I ſhall be ſurprized if we have  
them not in plenty before this day twelve-  
month, for I think Triſram Shandy muſt   
be dead and buried by that time.  

Fielding.  
WELL, but prythee Swift, give us ſome   
account of the work.  

Swift.  
 
( P69 )  
Swift.  
In a few words——it is a hotch potch of   
technical terms——broken sentencesb————trite  
ſatir-—obscenity——low buffoonery, without  
wit——humour——or deſign.  

Fielding.  
I beg pardon for interrupting you——but that   
word low is often given by the sons of dull-  
ness to humour the most exquisite——is there  
no humour in the book.  

Swift.  
WOULD you think there was humour——  
if  a blackguard in the ſtreet ſhould pull  
down his breeches and shew you his dirty——  
If you would, then there is humour in Trisſ-  
tram Shandy.  

Fielding.  
How the devil can the town be ſo absurd  
then, as to put this man in competition with   
you and me.  

Swift.  

( 70)  

Swift.  
BECAUSE they are a pack of aſſes——but  
do not imagine that all do ſo————a player  
that pretends to a taſte, perhaps, when he  
has none——or a rabble of faſhionable people  
may make a noiſe about him——as a mob  
often will do about nothing--but the few good  
judges, Mercury aſſures me, hold his book  
in the contemptible light it deſerves.  

Fielding.   
I fancy he owes the ſucceſs of it to its  
not being understood.  

Swift.  
HE does moft certainly——the majority of  
the world are ignorant————and ignorance,  
whatever face it may put upon it outward-  
ly, is always conscious——theſe, therefore,   
place to their own account—what ſhould be  
put to that of the author——true, they do   
not understand him——but they never conſider  
that he is not to be underſtood——in my opi-  
nion, any man who ſhould ſit down to  
write——if, at the ſame time, he was not ab-  
solutely void of what is called the funny   
ſtile, might produce as good a Work——only  
going  

( 71 )  
going upon theſimple principle, of putting  
down whatever came into his head.  

Fielding.  
But it piques my pride a little————that  
my Tom Jones ſhould be cry'd down for ſuch  
an upstart——my Tom Jones that coſt me ſo  
many years labour.  

Swift.  
FIELDING, this is no place to fear flat-  
tery——the fable of your Tom Jones, ſetting  
aside its other merits, which are exceſive,  
is enough to put your fame beyond the   
reach of the contemptible extollers of Triſ-   
tram Shandy.  

Fielding.  
MR. Dean, I know you ſpeak what you  
think——and, becauſe, this is a place where  
a man cannot be ſſpected of begging a far-  
ther compliment——I do aſſure you, by what  
I can learn——your moſt trifling pamphlet——  
nay, one of your letters to doctor Sheridan,  
contains more laughable matter than all Triſ-  
Tram Shandy.  

Swift  

( 72)   

Swift.  
I mu&ſt notſuffer my judgment to be bl-  
aſſed, there is a ſ;ermon in Triſtram Shan-  
dy; which, to the reſerve of ſome parts of  
the ſtile, is excellent. But it is introduced,   
in a manner moſt improper and irreverent.  

Fielding.   
I do not think we are to be too ſevere   
in criticiſing works of wit and humour, or   
in tying up an entertaining author in ſuch a manner,  
as not to ſuffer him to break out   
now and then into a little jocoſe merri-  
ment, though he ſhould ſometimes go be-  
yond even a double entendre. , But an ab-  
ſolute violation of all modeſty————to take  
the language of a book from the mouths of  
the inhabitants of Exeter-ſtreet, and Hedge  
lane. * * *  *Caetera desunt*.
